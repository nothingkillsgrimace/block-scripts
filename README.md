# block-scripts
Series of files used to generate custom TV blocks

Filepath structure:

These scripts are dependent on a fairly rigid file structure.\
To construct a block, you essentially need four main components:

1. Commercials
2. Promos
3. Bumps
4. Shows

Each should ideally be placed within its own folder separate from the others. 

These four components vary across different blocks, so it's good practice\
to keep them organized by Block Type. For instance, Adult Swim is kept\
separate from Nick at Nite which is kept separate from FOX.
